# LGAWSManager

"was" real is "aws", this is the sdk for amazon web service called "AWS", I had written wrong name for this floder, so sorry for this.


This is a manager of iOS amazon web service(AWS), It realizes the functions of Sign up, Sign in, Confirm, Send email now. It will be more, welcome to collection.
Now this manager can download and upload, you should set the BucketName first.
If your download file isn't a picture, change the call back block "UIImage" to "id" or the type you need.

这是对亚马逊的服务AWS的一个封装，它目前实现了注册，登录，确认和发送邮件，后面将持续加入新的功能，欢迎收藏
加入了下载和上传功能，需要先设置BucketName，如果下载的不是图片，请在回调block里修改 “UIImage” 为 “id”或你需要的类型
